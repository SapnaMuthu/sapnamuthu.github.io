## *Upcoming Term Project:*

Our Project idea is to develop a Food Recipe App that shows the user about the instructions on how to prepare a specific food item along with the extra information like the ingredients, nutrients, servings, and preparation time. The user can search with a particular keyword like "Pizza" and it would display all the available food recipes for Pizza. Afterward, the user can add a specific food recipe to the wish list if they like the recipe and scroll through the wish-listed food recipes later.

With my prior experience on developing a React Native App by integrating with the Firebase Database where I developed a Link Up App as described under the Projects Section, I believe that I will be able to develop the Food recipe as well.
